# Rule 006: Testing

- Effective: 2026-08-21
- Updated: 2026-09-04
- Priority: High
- Applies: Behavioral changes

1. Use Vitest for unit and custom-element contract tests.
2. Use happy-dom for the default DOM suite and Node for SSR import tests.
3. Test public attributes and properties without piercing a live `<sinap-si>` closed shadow root; focused factory tests may verify generated internals.
4. Use deterministic fakes for canvas, animation frames, and ResizeObserver.
5. Every regression fix requires a failing test or executable audit that proves the prior failure.
6. Keep aliases in Vitest synchronized with TypeScript and build configuration.
7. Add a real-browser check when behavior materially depends on an actual browser implementation.
8. Executable suites are colocated under `src/` and follow Rule 010.
9. `./cli/graph check` must include lint, source/test type checks, tests, builds, SemVer validation, and audits.

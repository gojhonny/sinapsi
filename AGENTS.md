# Sinapsi engineering instructions

This repository owns only the `@neongate-ai/sinapsi` npm package.

14. The relevant SPEC and linked ADRs.

## Repository boundaries

- Keep `<sinaps-i>` as the single runtime UI implementation.
- Keep the package framework-agnostic and SSR-safe.
- Do not add documentation-site code or framework example applications here.
- Do not add runtime framework wrappers.
- Treat public API additions as compatibility commitments.
- Run `graph check` before completing a release-oriented change.

## Harness, CLI, and Git gates

- A local root `pnpm install` provisions the managed user-scoped Graph launcher; after source setup, use `graph <command>` directly.
- `./cli/graph setup --launcher` is a recovery path when the launcher was disabled, moved, or needs refreshing.
- Do not require package-manager executable runners for repository Graph commands.
- `.agents/` contains context, ADRs, rules, specs, prompts, skills, and explicit workflows.
- `.audits/` contains deterministic repository checks.
- `graph help` lists the shell-only local engineering commands.
- Husky hooks are thin adapters in `cli/.husky/`; Graph owns pre-commit and commit-message behavior.
- `.cursor/hooks.json` enforces agent shell guardrails and fast post-edit feedback; release/publication boundaries remain human-controlled.
- `.agents/workflows/` contains explicit reusable task sequences; use them instead of inventing ad hoc release or regression procedures.
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits and package versions follow SemVer.
- Executable Vitest suites are colocated with source under `src/`.
- Start behavioral changes with a SPEC and link an ADR when architecture changes.
- Keep a `readme.md` in every directory under `.agents/` and `.audits/`.

## Task routing

- Regression: use `.agents/workflows/regression-fix.md` plus the relevant domain skill.
- Review: use `.agents/workflows/review.md`; the optional Cursor `sinapsi-reviewer` subagent is review-only.
- Release: use `.agents/workflows/release.md`; agents must stop for human approval at tag/push/publish boundaries.
- Harness improvement: use `.agents/workflows/harness-improvement.md` and Rule 012.

## Engineering harness command

Run `graph harness` explicitly when the repository harness needs scoring or reconciliation. Harness tooling is engineering-only and must never run automatically from install, build, test, or CI lifecycle hooks.
